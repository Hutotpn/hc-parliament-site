"heya!

i've talked with some of the other people who help run #parliament. while we appreciate you trying to help, it'd be very nice if you discussed stuff like this beforehand in #dosem.

parliament vote is open source @ github.com/hcgov/parliament-vote, and the hcgov.uk website which i also noticed you were trying to rewrite is also open source @ github.com/hcgov/parliament.

while we appreciate you were trying to help, please talk to us before you do stuff like this! parliament can only go smoothly if everyone knows what's happening and works together.

feel free to help out in #dosem if you want to though! not stopping you from doing that."
